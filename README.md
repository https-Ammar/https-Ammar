```swift
public struct AboutMe {
    let name = "Jay"
    var pronouns = ["he","him"]
    
    let profession = "iOS Engineer @ Matter Neuroscience"
    
    var preferredTechStack = ["swift", "swiftui", "cloudkit", "core data"]
    var hasUsed = ["react", "javascript", "firebase"]
}
```

I solve problems using the tools available to me. I generally like using Swift and SwiftUI but not afraid to try something new.
